# Voice Control Python Projects

### 1. **Text-to-Audio & Audio-to-Text with NLP (Text_to_audio___audio_to_text.ipynb):**
  - Employ cutting-edge libraries like Whisper by OpenAI and Deep Learning networks.
  - Record audio using your device's microphone.
  - Transcribe recorded audio into text with exceptional accuracy.
  - Translate audio content into various languages, fostering seamless communication across borders.
     
 ### 2. **Audio Commands (Audio_Command.py):**
   - Execute Python functions or scripts directly through voice commands issued from your terminal.
   - Leverages NLP for accurate speech recognition, transforming spoken instructions into actionable code.
   - Manages dependencies with requirements.txt: This file lists all the necessary libraries for running the script.

This project equips you with the tools to build interactive voice-driven applications in Python, streamlining your workflow and enhancing accessibility.
